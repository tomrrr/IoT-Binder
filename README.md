# IoT-Binder By Tom and Charlie
This is a entry in SERAS Environment Making Competition

This code is designed to contol a binder allowing a greater range of activity (maybe swap to movement) for people who bind.

When wearing a binder, you are not supposed to run and exert yourself. This allows the user to interact (with the binder) without having to change or get undressed. This problem is especially prevalent for asthmatics.

This code was writen for a ESP32 dev board. Follow how to set up the Arduino software in the PDF. Then download the code. Add WiFi username and password. Then go to the ip that it gives in the terminal and have fun.

Note: Remeber to set the serial moniter to 115200
